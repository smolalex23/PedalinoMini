Wireless MIDI foot controller for guitarists and more.

You can change the presets of your guitar rig, turn old MIDI equipment into something that’s USB-compatible, give you hands-free or foot-occupied ways to control your rig during a live performance, and it can be done with WiFi or Bluetooth. This is a full-featured MIDI controller, with three user profiles, and it can control a maximum of 36 foot switches. That’s an impressive amount of kit for such a small device; usually you’d have to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a simple MIDI controller, and the PedalinoMini does everything with very cheap hardware.

## Bill of materials

The shortest bill of materials ever: an ESP32 board and a OLED display. That's it.

- Any ESP32 board supported by [Arduino core for ESP32 WiFi chip](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)
  - Tested on [DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1](https://github.com/SmartArduino/SZDOITWiKi/wiki/ESP8266---ESP32) 4M dual-mode Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module
- OLED I2C 0.96"/1.3" display 128x64 pixels SSD1306/SH1106 based

Not enough short?

- An all-in-one [TTGO T-Display](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50033&Id=1126&FId=t3:50033:3) with an 1.14" IPS display and onboard lithium battery interface

- An all-in-one [Heltec WiFi Kit 32](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-kit-32/) with an integrated OLED display (0.96") and onboard lithium battery interface

- An all-in-one [TTGO T-Eight ESP32](https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T-Eight-ESP32) with a bigger OLED display (1.3"), 4MB PSRAM and onboard lithium battery interface

USB MIDI and DIN MIDI connection requires additional hardware.

## Schematic

![Schematic1](./images/Schematic_PedalinoMini_Sheet-1.svg "Schematic1")
![Schematic2](./images/Schematic_PedalinoMini_Sheet-2.svg "Schematic2")
![Schematic2](./images/Schematic_PedalinoMini_Sheet-3.svg "Schematic3")

Do not forget the add the pull-up resistors on PIN_A1 to PIN_A6 otherwise pins will be floating. A floating pin can trigger unexpected MIDI events. As alternative you can disable the not used pedals via web interface.

## How to upload firmware, WiFi provisioning and access to web user interface

## USB MIDI

The cheapest and compact way to implement an USB MIDI connection is using an Arduino Pro Micro and the [BlokasLabs/USBMIDI](https://github.com/BlokasLabs/USBMIDI) library. Upload the [UsbMidiConverter](https://github.com/BlokasLabs/USBMIDI/blob/master/examples/UsbMidiConverter/UsbMidiConverter.ino) example into the Arduino Pro Micro.

Serial1 of ESP32 (re-mapped to pin 18 RX and 19 TX) is connected to Serial1 (pin 1 TX0 and pin 2 RX1) of Arduino Pro Micro. Use a 3.3V Pro Micro board. A 5V Pro Micro board works too because the ESP32 is usually 5V tolerant.

Arduino Pro Micro is powered by the USB MIDI connection.

IMPORTANT: ESP32 board and Arduino Pro Micro must share GND.

## Booting modes

PedalinoMini™ has 8 booting modes:

Mode|Name|Description
----|----|-----------
1|Normal|BLE and WiFi are enabled. PedalinoMini™ starts the WiFi procedure on boot (connect to last AP -> SmartConfig -> WPS -> Access Point).<br>After boot PedalinoMini™ will wait for BLE-MIDI connection.
2|Bluetooth Only|WiFi are Web UI are disabled.<br> PedalinoMini™ will wait for BLE-MIDI connection only.
3|WiFi Only|PedalinoMini™ starts the WiFi procedure on boot (connect to last AP -> SmartConfig -> WPS -> Access Point).<br>BLE is disabled.
4|Access Point with Bluetooth|PedalinoMini™ skip the WiFi procedure on boot and create a WiFi Access Point.<br>PedalinoMini™ will wait for BLE-MIDI connection too.
5|Access Point without Bluetooth|PedalinoMini™ skips the WiFi procedure on boot and create a WiFi Access Point.<br>BLE is disabled.
6|Reset WiFi credentials|Forget the last connected access point.<br>On next boot PedalinoMini™ can be connected to a new AP.
7|Ladder Config|Learn mode for your ladder pedal. Any resistors ladder (up to 6 buttons) can be calibrated just pressing footswitches in any sequence. During calibration press and hold the footswitch until the timeout expires (the upper bar reaches zero) and the measure is acquired with a value in the botton bar. After calibration footswitches are numbered depending of the corresponding analog value: lower value lower number. TC HELICON Switch-6 footswitch 1 correspond to button 6, footswitch 2 to button 5, and so on until footswitch 6 to button 1.<br>Configure at least one pedal as Ladder before to proceed with configuration.
8|Reset to factory default|

The last booting mode (1-5) is selected if you don't press any button on boot.

The default boot mode is (1) Normal.

To select a different mode:

- Press and release EN button (POWER button on TTGO T-Eight) and immediately after press and hold BOOT button (CENTER button on TTGO T-Eight)
- Follow the istructions on display. Keep it pressed until the progress bar reach the end to reset to factory default. If you release the button before the progress bar reach the end PedalinoMini™ will start in one of the supported boot mode.

Mode|Name|USB-MIDI|Legacy MIDI|RTP-MIDI|ipMIDI|BLE MIDI|OSC|Web UI|OTA Firmware Update|HTTP Firmware Update
:--:|----|:------:|:---------:|:------:|:----:|:------:|:-:|:----:|:-----------------:|:------------------:

5|Access Point without Bluetooth|x|x|x|x|-|x|x|x|x

- (x) Supported
  (-) Not supported
- USB-MIDI and DIN-MIDI are always available if hardware implemented.

## How to build and upload

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) is the recommended IDE for PedalinoMini™ build and upload.

1. Install [PlatformIO IDE for VSCode](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
2. Install Git
    - On Windows, install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
    - On macOS, install Command Line Tools for Xcode running `xcode-select --install` via Terminal. Remember to run the command every time you update your macOS.
3. In VSCode run the following commands:
    - from View->Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
        - Git: Clone
        - You will be asked for the URL of the remote repository (<https://github.com/alf45tar/PedalinoMini>) and the parent directory under which to put the local repository.
    - under PlatformIO Project Tasks select your environment (i.e. env:esp32doit-devkit-v1)
        - Click "Build" under General
        - Click "Upload" under General
        - Click “Upload File System Image” under Platform. Do not skip this step otherwise the WebUI will not works properly.

That's all folks.

> Before any update save configuration, reset to factory default and reload configuration. EEPROM can change without any further advice.

## How to connect PedalinoMini™ to a WiFi network

PedalinoMini™ supports IEEE 802.11 b/g/n WiFi with WPA/WPA2 authentication (only 2.4 GHz).

PedalinoMini™ support 4 WiFi provisioning methods: 1 via USB and 3 via WiFi.

PedalinoMini™ is using [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) not only to install the firmware with a click of button right from you browser but also to connect it to WiFi with the same simplicity.

PedalinoMini™ also implements Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and Smart Config technology ([Espressif’s ESP-TOUCH protocol](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-touch/overview)). WPS needs access to the WPS button on the WiFi router. Smart Config requires a smartphone with one the following apps:

- [ESP8266 SmartConfig](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmmakerclub.iot.esptouch) for Android
- [Espressif Esptouch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/espressif-esptouch/id1071176700?mt=8) for iOS

If the WiFi network is not available PedalinoMini™ will create an hotspot for you. Once connected to the PedalinoMini™ hotspot, you can use the web interface to set the SSID and password of an access point that you would like to connect to.

- On power on PedalinoMini™ will try to connect to the last know access point
- If it cannot connect to the last used access point within 15 seconds it enters into WiFi provisioning mode via USB
- Visit http://alf45tar.github.io/PedalinoMini/installer and follow the instructions
- If provisioning via USB is not finished within 60 seconds it enters into Smart Config mode (if compiled with -D SMARTCONFIG in platformio.ini)
- Start one of the suggested apps to configure SSID and password
- If it doesn't receive any SSID and password during the next 60 seconds it enters into WPS mode (if compiled with -D WPS in platformio.ini)
- Press or press and hold (it depends by your router) the WPS button on your WiFi router __after__ PedalinoMini™ entered in WPS mode
- If it doesn't receive any SSID and password during the next 60 seconds it switch to AP mode
- In AP mode PedalinoMini™ create a WiFi network called 'Pedalino-XXXXXXXX' waiting connection from clients. The required password is XXXXXXXX (uppercase). XXXXXXXX is a variable string.
- Reboot PedalinoMini™ to restart the procedure.

Any of the previous steps can be skipped pressing BOOT button.

```C++
void wifi_connect()
{
  auto_reconnect();           // WIFI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT seconds to reconnect to last used access point
  if (!WiFi.isConnected())
    improv_config();          // IMPROV_CONFIG_TIMEOUT seconds to receive provisioning SSID and password via USB and connect to WiFi
  if (!WiFi.isConnected())
    smart_config();           // SMART_CONFIG_TIMEOUT seconds to receive SmartConfig parameters and connect
  if (!WiFi.isConnected())
    wps_config();             // WPS_TIMEOUT seconds to receive WPS parameters and connect
  if (!WiFi.isConnected())
    ap_mode_start();          // switch to AP mode until next reboot
}
```

## How to connect to the web user intertace

The responsive and mobile-first configuration web user interface is available on `http://device-name.local` address (the address is case insensitive). The device identification name is unique per device. Every device/board has a different device name. For example I am using `http://2ab267ac.local` to connect to my PedalinoMini™.

![WEBUI HOME](./images/webui-home.png "Home")

In order to know your device name and/or the IP address press for at least half a second the BOOT button and check the display.

As alternative method you can use the IP address. If you are using the AP mode the IP address is always `192.168.4.1` and the connection address is `http://192.168.4.1` for everyone.

The default username and password to connect to web user interface are `admin` as username and your `device-name` in __uppercase__ as password. For example I am using `admin` as username and `2AB267AC` as password.

Device name, username and password can be changed via web user interface in the Options page.

## Pedals

Once PedalinoMini™ is connected to a WiFI network and you are connected to the web user interface it is time to configure which pedal is connected to each of the 6 available ports. Pedal 7, 8 and 9 (if present) are the on board buttons and they are fully configurable.

![WEBUI PEDALS](./images/webui-pedals1.png "Pedals 1-4")

![WEBUI PEDALS](./images/webui-pedals2.png "Pedals 5-8")

____________|Description
:-----------|:----------
Mode|Select one of the following: NONE, MOMENTARY, LATCH, ANALOG, JOG WHEEL, MOMENTARY 2, MOMENTARY 3, LATCH 2, LADDER, ULTRASONIC, ANALOG+MOMENTARY, ANALOG+LATCH.
Invert Polarity|Normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) momentary switches are supported and configurable by software if the foot switch do not have a polarity switch. On analog pedal or ultrasonic ranging sensor it invert the range.
Singles Press|Select Enable/Disable here to enable/disable PRESS, RELEASE and CLICK events.<br>CLICK event is detected after a PRESS followed by a RELEASE event on momentary switches and on PRESS and on RELEASE on latch switches.
Double Press|Select Enable/Disable here to enable/disable DOUBLE CLICK events.<br>If double press is enabled CLICK event is postponed until double press timeout (by default 400ms).
Long Press|Select Enable/Disable here to enable/disable LONG PRESS, REPEAT PRESSED and LONG RELEASE events.<br>LONG PRESS event is detected after a PRESS event with no RELEASE event within the long press timeout (by default 500ms).<br>After a LONG PRESS event a REPEAT PRESSED event is triggered every repeat press timeout (by default 500ms) until the button is keep pressed.<br>After a LONG PRESS event the RELEASE event is replaced by a LONG RELEASE event.<br>Two sequences of events are possible: PRESS and RELEASE or PRESS, LONG PRESS, REPEAT PRESS (optional) and LONG RELEASE.
Analog Calibration|Enable analog pedal continuous calibration. Min and Max values are managed by PedalinoMini™. After each power on cycle move the expression pedals to its full range and PedalinoMini™ will calibrate it. During the first full movement of the pedal MIDI events could be not precise because PedalinoMini™ is still learning the full range of the pedal.
Analog Response|Mapping between analog pedal movement and response. Accepted values: LINEAR (as is response), LOG (great acceleration but than flat), ANTILOG (start slow with a rapid increase).
Min|In ANALOG mode minumum digital value (after analog-to-digital conversion) that can reach the connected expression pedal.<br>In ULTRASONIC mode the minimum distance (250 is around 2cm and it is not recommended to go below). Acceptable values are from 0 to 1023
Max|In ANALOG mode maximum digital value (after analog-to-digital conversion) that can reach the connected expression pedal.<br>In ULTRASONIC mode the maximum distance (1023 is around 18cm and it is far enough for the application). Acceptable values are from 0 to 1023.
Easing|It controls the amount of easing. Possible values are: 1, 2 or 3. Bigger value makes the responsive values more responsive: output value follows immediately the input value. Recommended values: 1 for ultrasonic sensor, 2 or 3 for potentiometer.
Activity Threshold|The amount of movement that must take place for it to register as activity and start moving the output value. Increase the value to suppress noisy potentiometer. Recommended values: 8 or 16 for potentiometer, 64 for ultrasonic sensor.
Button1 ... Button6|Define for each button of the pedal the default led number to be used in Actions

## Controls

A control is a single switch of pedal (i.e. button 2 of pedal 4) or a combination of 2 switched of any pedal to be pressed simultaneous. Controls are used to logical sort and hide the physical connection of switches or to define a new control as simultaneous press of 2 switches.

Actions are triggered by controls. As a consequence a control is needed also for analog and ultrasonic pedals.

Due to hardware limitation simultaneous press do not works with 2 switches of the same MOMENTARY 3, LATCH 3 and LADDER. Instead simultaneous press works well between one switch of a MOMENTARY 3/LATCH 3/LADDER pedal and any other switch of a different pedal of any type. Simultaneous press works well between the 2 switches of the same MOMENTARY 2 or LADDER 2 pedal.

For each control it is possible to define the default led number to be used in Actions. It helps to simply the hardware leds connections but keeping each led logically linked to a switch.

Of course the simultaneous release, double click and long press are supported too even if they are not so usefull.

![WEBUI CONTROLS](./images/webui-controls.png "Controls")

## Actions

Once Controls setup is complete proceed with Actions setup to define which event (press, release, double press, long press, repeat pressed, long release, move or jog) trigger an action.

1. Select a bank on top left. Bank 0 is also called gloabl bank. Actions added to bank 0 are active in all the others banks.
2. Select a control on top right or "All"
3. (Optional) Enter the Bank Name
4. Click on New Action and select a pedal on the dropdown menu. The pedal number of an action cannot be changed anymore without delete and recreate the action.

![WEBUI PEDALS](./images/webui-actions.png "Actions")

________|Description
:-------|:----------
On|The event that trigger the action.<br>Momentary switches, latches and ladders have 7 different events: PRESS, RELEASE, CLICK, DOUBLE CLICK, LONG PRESS, REPEAT PRESSED and LONG RELEASE. All of them need to be enabled on Pedals level otherwise the action is not triggered.<br>Analog expression pedals have only MOVE event.<br>Jog wheels have only JOG event.
Control|The control that trigger the event as defined in Controls page.
Send|The action to be triggered on event.<br>It can be a MIDI message (PROGRAM CHANGE, CONTROL CHANGE, NOTE ON, NOTE OFF, PITCH BEND, CHANNEL PRESSURE, START, STOP, CONTINUE), a special action (BANK SELECT+, BANK SELECT-, PROGRAM CHANGE+, PROGRAM CHANGE-, BANK+, BANK-, MTC START, MTC STOP, MTC CONTINUE, TAP, BPM+, BPM-) or a SEQUENCE of them.<br>For an analog pedal leave it blank to activate the universal mode. In universal mode an analog pedal can be used to repeat the last MIDI message. A typical usage is to modify the value of the last CONTROL CHANGE.
From Value/To Value|Define the range from a off value to a on value (see below).
Tags When Off|Action name to display when off action is triggered.
Tags When On|Action name to display when on action is triggered.
Led|Select the led number and the off and on color. Use Default for use the default led defined in Pedals.

- LSB is the Less Significat Byte. It is the variable value from 0 to 127.

## Interfaces

![WEBUI INTERFACES](./images/webui-interfaces.png "Interfaces")

The supported interfaces are:

Interface|Description
:--------|:----------
USB MIDI|Plug&play USB MIDI interface. Requires additional hardware (see schematic).
Legacy MIDI|Legacy serial MIDI interface with 5 pins DIN connectors. Requires additional hardware (see schematic).
RTP-MIDI|RTP-MIDI also know as AppleMIDI or Network MIDI. It is based on UDP protocol and it requires WiFi.
ipMIDI|ipMIDI is a multicast UDP protocol and it requires WiFi. ipMIDI works only if both end points are connected to the same 2.4 GHz WiFi network. Same router is not enough when one end point is connected to a 5 GHz WiFi network or to a different 2.4 GHz WiFI network hosted by the same router.
BLE MIDI|Requires Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
OSC|OSC messages are based on UDP protocol and it requires WiFi.

For each interface there are 4 filtering options:

______|Description
:-----|:----------
IN|Enable/disable receiving MIDI messages from the interface
OUT|Enable/disable sending MIDI messages to the interface
THRU|Enable/disable so called MIDI Thru (every message received from the IN port is automatically sent to the OUT port of the same interface)
CLOCK|Enable/disable receiving and sending CLOCK MIDI message

Routing between different interfaces is enabled between every IN enabled interfaces to any OUT enabled interfaces. Do not confuse routing (different interfaces) with MIDI Thru (between IN and OUT of same interface).

## Sequences

Some example configurations are provides. The default configuration for [PedalinoMini™ Case 1](https://github.com/alf45tar/PedalinoMini-Case-1) is available as 'case1'.

### iRig BlueBoard

PedalinoMini™ can emulate an [IK Multimedia iRig Blueboard](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigblueboard/) using 'blueboard' configuration. Midi Mode 1 is on bank 1 and Midi Mode 2 is on bank 2. PedalinoMini™ emulation works on any MIDI interface and not only "MIDI over Bluetooth" as the original iRig Blueboard.

### Fender Mustang Amplifier

PedalinoMini™ can control a Fender Mustang I/II/III/IV Amplifier via MIDI. Additional [software](https://github.com/alf45tar/mustang-midi-bridge-win) is required to translate MIDI messages to the proprietary USB protocol used by Fender Mustang amplifiers. The bonus configuration is called 'mustang' and works with 3 momentary switches and 3 jog wheels.
